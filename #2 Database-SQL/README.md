# Database

This section is dedicated to understanding and working with **Databases** in the context of software development.  
It will cover two main parts:

1. **Database Design** → how to plan and structure databases effectively before implementation.  
2. **SQL (Structured Query Language)** → the language used to interact with relational databases.

The goal is to provide both **theoretical foundations** (design principles, normalization, ER diagrams) and **practical knowledge** (SQL queries, constraints, transactions).
