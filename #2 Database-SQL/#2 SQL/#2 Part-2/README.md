## üìù 1. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

In this category, we deal directly with the **values (records)** inside the database.  
The main operations are: INSERT ‚Üí Add new records, UPDATE ‚Üí Modify existing records, DELETE ‚Üí Remove records.  

### üîπ INSERT
The INSERT statement is used to add new records into a table.  

To add a single record we write:  
```sql
    INSERT INTO TableName  
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3);  
```
Here, the values must follow the same order of the table columns.  

To add multiple records at once we write them separated by commas: 
```sql 
    INSERT INTO TableName  
    VALUES  
        (value1, value2, value3),  
        (value4, value5, value6),  
        (value7, value8, value9);  
```
We can also insert into specific columns only by listing their names:
```sql  
    INSERT INTO TableName (Column1, Column2)  
    VALUES (value1, value2);  
```
‚ö° Important Notes:  
If a column is not specified in the INSERT statement, it must satisfy at least one of the following conditions:  
1. It is an Identity column ‚Üí generated automatically.  
2. It has a Default Value.  
3. It is a Timestamp column ‚Üí automatically filled with the current time.  
4. It allows NULL values.  
5. It is a Computed column ‚Üí automatically calculated.
