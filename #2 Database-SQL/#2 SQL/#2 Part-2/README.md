## üìù 1. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

In this category, we deal directly with the **values (records)** inside the database.  
The main operations are: INSERT ‚Üí Add new records, UPDATE ‚Üí Modify existing records, DELETE ‚Üí Remove records.  

### üîπ INSERT
The INSERT statement is used to add new records into a table.  

To add a single record we write:  
```sql
    INSERT INTO TableName  
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3);  
```
Here, the values must follow the same order of the table columns.  

To add multiple records at once we write them separated by commas: 
```sql 
    INSERT INTO TableName  
    VALUES  
        (value1, value2, value3),  
        (value4, value5, value6),  
        (value7, value8, value9);  
```
We can also insert into specific columns only by listing their names:
```sql  
    INSERT INTO TableName (Column1, Column2)  
    VALUES (value1, value2);  
```
‚ö° Important Notes:  
If a column is not specified in the INSERT statement, it must satisfy at least one of the following conditions:  
1. It is an Identity column ‚Üí generated automatically.  
2. It has a Default Value.  
3. It is a Timestamp column ‚Üí automatically filled with the current time.  
4. It allows NULL values.  
5. It is a Computed column ‚Üí automatically calculated.  

### üîπ UPDATE
The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing values in a record.  

To update a column for **all rows**:  
```sql
UPDATE TableName
SET ColumnName = value;
```
‚ö†Ô∏è This will change the value for every row in that column.

To update a specific row, we use a condition:
```sql 
UPDATE TableName
SET ColumnName = value
WHERE Condition;
```
The condition usually targets the Primary Key (PK) or an Identity column, for example:
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 5000
WHERE ID = 4;
```
We can also update multiple columns at once:
```sql
UPDATE TableName
SET Column1 = value1, Column2 = value2
WHERE Condition;
```
To update multiple rows at once, we control the condition to match more than one record. 

For example, increase the salary by 10% for all female employees earning less than or equal to 4000:
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary + (Salary * 0.1)
WHERE Gender = 'F' AND Salary <= 4000;
```

### üîπ DELETE
The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records from a table.  

To delete **all records** in a table:  
```sql
DELETE FROM TableName;
```
To delete a specific record, we use a condition:
```sql
DELETE FROM TableName
WHERE Condition;
```
‚ö° Important Notes:

1. The condition usually targets the Primary Key (PK) or another unique column.
2. You can only delete records that do not have related data in other tables (no existing Foreign Key references).
3. If a record is referenced by another table, you must delete the relationship first (or set the FK to NULL) before deleting the record.

## üìù 2. Data Query Language (DQL) - SELECT

DQL is mainly about **displaying data** without changing anything in the database.  
The primary command is `SELECT`.  

Before working with a database, it is important to check its **diagram** to understand the tables and their relationships.  

---
### üîπ Basic SELECT
To select specific columns from a table:  
```sql
SELECT ColumnName
FROM TableName;
```
To select all columns from a table, use *:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName;
```
###üîπ SELECT with Condition
To display specific records based on a condition:
```sql
SELECT ColumnName
FROM TableName
WHERE Condition;
```
### üîπ Range Conditions
We can filter rows using range conditions:
1. With **AND**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column >= MinValue AND Column <= MaxValue;
```
2. With **BETWEEN**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column BETWEEN MinValue AND MaxValue;
```
3. To exclude a range, use ***NOT BETWEEN**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column NOT BETWEEN MinValue AND MaxValue;
```
### üîπ Multiple Values
If a record can match multiple values:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column = Value1 OR Column = Value2;
```
Or use **IN**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column IN (Value1, Value2, Value3);
```
To exclude values, use ***NOT IN**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column NOT IN (Value1, Value2, Value3);
```
### üîπ NULL Values
NULL is not considered a value, so normal conditions don‚Äôt work with it.
Check for null:
```sql 
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column IS NULL;
```
Check for not null:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column IS NOT NULL;
```
### üîπ Pattern Matching (LIKE with Wildcards)

The LIKE operator is used with wildcards to match patterns in text.
Wildcards:
- _ ‚Üí Matches a single character.
- % ‚Üí Matches zero, one, or many characters.
- [] ‚Üí Matches any character within the brackets.
- [^] ‚Üí Matches any character not in the brackets.
- [-] ‚Üí Matches a range of characters.

Ex:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TableName
WHERE Column LIKE '_a';
```
üëâ This means the second character must be a.
